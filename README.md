# Snails of Alabama

<P> Snails of Alabama is a project to document all extant and recently extinct land and freshwater snails within Alabama.

<P> The idea for this project came about when I tried to identify various snails using iNaturalist's app. The AI is typically very good when identifying plants and animals to the species level or at least to the genus or family. With snails however the app's AI provides a completely wrong answer almost every time. And it's easy to understand why, because at first glance many snails are not only similar but actually indistinguishable from some angles. For some species dissection is even needed to produce a confident identification. 
  
<P> I searched for an identification guide for Alabama or Southeastern snails and could not find one that was more than a list, which surprised me. Alabama has the most species of land and freshwater snails in all of North America. So, I decided to make my own identification guide, mostly for my own benefit but hopefully of use to others as well. I am a geologist, not a biologist, so please do not consider what I document as authoritative, but I will strive to document and source all information in this guide. 
  
<P> My goals are threefold. First, To create a well sourced and taxonomically up-to-date list of every land and freshwater snail that has been confirmed to exist in Alabama. Second, to collate information on each species, including but not limited to range, habitat, identifying features, and conservation status. Lastly, once I have gathered enough information I will create a guide of some sort that anyone could use to pick up a snail from the ground and identify it the species or genus level. 
  
<P> As of early April 2022 I have mostly completed the first goal, having documented in Alabama 370 snails, 175 land and 195 freshwater, that currently exist or have recently gone extinct. I am still in the process of formatting the list and hope to upload a copy soon. In the meantime I have created a list of snail families in the project wiki linking to individual family pages which list all genera, species, and common names. Part of my second goal is to create a wiki page for each species. This will likely take some time. As I finish entries for each species in the wiki I will update the README to show my progress.
